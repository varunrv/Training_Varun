ANGRY PROFESSOR:
A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of  students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than  students are present when class starts.
Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled.


CUT THE STICKS:
You are given  sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:

5 4 4 2 2 8
Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 

3 2 2 6
The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.
Given the length of  sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.


DIVISIBLE SUM PAIRS
You are given an array of  integers, , and a positive integer, . Find and print the number of pairs where  and  +  is evenly divisible by .
Input Format
The first line contains  space-separated integers,  and , respectively. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of .
Output Format
Print the number of  pairs where  and  +  is evenly divisible by .

JUMPING ON THE CLOUDS
Emma is playing a new mobile game involving  clouds numbered from  to . A player initially starts out on cloud , and they must jump to cloud . In each step, she can jump from any cloud  to cloud  or cloud .
There are two types of clouds, ordinary clouds and thunderclouds. The game ends if Emma jumps onto a thundercloud, but if she reaches the last cloud (i.e., ), she wins the game!
Can you find the minimum number of jumps Emma must make to win the game? It is guaranteed that clouds  and  are ordinary-clouds and it is always possible to win the game.



KANGAROOS:
There are two kangaroos on an x-axis ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). The first kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if they'll ever land at the same location at the same time?


PANGRAMS:
Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his friend advised him to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)
After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.
Given a sentence , tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.
