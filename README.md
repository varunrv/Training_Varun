PANGRAMS:
Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his friend advised him to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)
After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.
Given a sentence , tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.


KANGAROOS:
There are two kangaroos on an x-axis ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). The first kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if they'll ever land at the same location at the same time?


CUT THE STICKS:
You are given  sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:

5 4 4 2 2 8
Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 

3 2 2 6
The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.
Given the length of  sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.


ANGRY PROFESSOR:
A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of  students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than  students are present when class starts.
Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled.
